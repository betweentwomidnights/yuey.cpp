# ABOUTME: Builds yuey against whatever ggml revision is checked out and runs
# ABOUTME: the fixture-free test suite, for pull requests that move the pointer.
#
# The shared ggml fork backs several projects (audiocraft.cpp, sa3.cpp,
# acestep.cpp, yue2.cpp), so a change there can break a consumer that the
# change's author never builds. Every consumer carries this script under the
# same path, which lets one job validate any of them without knowing how any
# of them are built: check the repo out, point its ggml at the revision under
# test, run ci/ggml-check.sh.
#
# CPU only and no model weights, so it runs on an ordinary hosted runner. That
# means a backend-specific change compiles here but is not exercised: the CUDA
# and Metal paths still need a machine that has one. What this does catch is
# the common case, a ggml change that alters an interface or a behaviour some
# consumer depends on.
